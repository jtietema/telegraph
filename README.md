# Telegraph - An messaging app for the open minded

Telegraph aims to replace messaging apps like SMS, MMS, WhatsApp and Viber by building a quality messaging app on
XMPP. So you can use your existing accounts (GTalk, Facebook Chat, etc.) for messaging.

*Why another XMPP app?* Most XMPP apps are built as instant messaging apps or chat apps. They don't accomodate slow chat
or messaging very well. For instance in most XMPP apps you can't easily chat with offline people.

For trivial bugfixes you can just submit a pull request. For developing new features it's better to contact me first
before starting with development.

This currently on the TODO are:

  * Notifications when receiving new messages
  * Downloading user avatars
  * Feedback when sending messages to an offline recipient
  * Polish in the UI
